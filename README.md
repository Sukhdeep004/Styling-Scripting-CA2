QUESTION-

Q1 Create a webpage that allows a teacher to track and display student attendance.
Requirements:

The page should provide input fields to enter a student’s name and attendance status (e.g., Present/Absent), and add the entry as a new row in a dynamic table.

  • The table and its rows must be created and managed using DOM methods like createElement, appendChild, etc.

  • Each row must include a delete option to remove it.

Include a button that simulates fetching attendance from an external system (e.g., “Load Records”).

  • The data must be returned after a delay using a Promise.
  
  • The result must be handled using async/await.

The dynamic table should support updating the status of any student record (e.g., changing Absent to Present) without reloading the page.

  • DOM access must be done using methods such as querySelector or getElementById.

Use CSS to make the table and interface visually organized and user-friendly.
